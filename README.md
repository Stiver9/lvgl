# lvgl_game

LVGL is an open-source graphics library for creating modern GUIs. It has plenty of built-in graphical elements with low memory footprint, which is friendly for embedded GUI applications.

This project was created for the LILYGO T-QT development board, the main control chip of which is ESP32-S3 (https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-QT). The project is based on the code of LVGL porting example. The whole porting code is located in main.c, and the UI game code is located in animation.c. Images used were converted to C arrays by the online converting tool (https://level.io/tools/image converter).
